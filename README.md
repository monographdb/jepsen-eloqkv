# Redis-Raft Jepsen Test

This is a test suite, written using the [Jepsen distributed systems testing
library](https://jepsen.io), for
[Redis-Raft](https://github.com/RedisLabs/redisraft). It provides a single
workload (`jepsen.redis.append`) based on list append, implemented using
`LRANGE` and `RPUSH`, which uses [Elle](https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle) to find transactional anomalies up to strict serializability.

We include a wide variety of faults, including network partitions, process crashes, pauses, clock skew, and membership changes.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a Jepsen cluster running Debian 9, which you can either [build
yourself](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen#setting-up-a-jepsen-environment)
or run in
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01LZ7Y7U0?qid=1486758124485&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title)
via Cloudformation.

The control node needs a JVM, Graphviz, and the [Leiningen
build system](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation). The first
two you can get (on Debian) via:

```
sudo apt install openjdk8-jdk graphviz
```

Jepsen will automatically install dependencies (e.g. git, build tools, various
support libraries) on DB nodes, and clone and build both Redis and Redis-Raft
locally on each DB node (to avoid cross-compilation issues). To do this, root
on each DB node will need an SSH key with access to the Redis-Raft repo on
GitHub, and the GitHub public SSH key in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`---see below.

## Usage

To get started, try
```bash
lein run test-all --node compute-6 --node store-1 --node store-2 --username eloq --password eloq --time-limit 380  --nemesis partition,kill   --workload append  --nemesis-interval 20 --max-writes-per-key 16 --max-txn-length 4 --test-count 1 --auto-start
```


Manually test flushdb issue
```bash
bash scripts/run_and_check.bash 
```

To focus on a particular set of faults, use `--nemesis`

## FAQ

### Host key verification failed

```
Cloning into 'redis'...
Host key verification failed.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

Redis-Raft is a private repo, and we clone it directly from Github. That means
your root user on each DB node will need an SSH key with read access to that
repo installed on each DB node, and git on each DB node will need to know about
the SSH key for GitHub. You should verify the host key from GH directly, rather
than keyscanning it. If you like to live dangerously, which, again, you should
not, you can blindly accept whatever key you get via:

```
ssh n1 "sudo bash -c 'ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts'"
ssh n2 ...
ssh n3 ...
...
```
